                        </div>

                        <div class="sectionContent">
                            <h1>When did your interest in IT start?</h1>
                            <p>I first became interested in IT at around the age of 5-6 through a program called SketchUp, a simple 3D modelling application. Interacting with the virtual objects onscreen was like magic to me, and I would spend hours experimenting with different designs and combinations every day.
                                <br><br>
                                <img src="sketchup.jpg" alt="An early version of SketchUp"/>
                                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #9b9b9b; font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: -12px;">An early version of SketchUp.</p>
                            <h1>What is your interest in IT?</h1>
                            <p>I’m interested in IT for two reasons, the first of which is the potential it holds for my own personal expression. I’m an artist at heart, and I think that having a solid grasp of the fundamentals of IT and programming will allow me to see my future ambitions through to completion.
                                <br><br>
                                The second reason is the career security that an IT qualification provides; the world is becoming more influenced by IT every day. So, having a pathway into that industry through a degree is incredibly advantageous.</p>
                            
                            <h1>Why RMIT?</h1>
                            <p>Two years ago, I would never have pictured myself at University. I was working as a video editor with a small production company, and pretty was satisfied. It wasn’t long after my company started receiving work from various Australian universities, advertisements mainly, and I was tasked with editing them. Long story short, I edited so many University ads, analysed so many student testimonials, and listened to so much sales talk that I think I ended up selling myself on pursuing a degree, bringing me here.</p>
                            
                            <h1>What do you expect to learn?</h1>
                            <p>I hope to learn the fundamentals of many relevant technologies, become familiar with using various programming languages and 3rd party applications, learn basic web development, and get an appreciation for working in a team environment similar to that of in the industry.
                                Writing is a good indication of understanding, but understanding is not an indication of experience, so I hope to acquire a hands-on level of practical knowledge to go with it.
                                <br>Hopefully, I will get to engage with the technology as much as I write about it.</p>

                            <h1>Personal Interpretation</h1>
                            <p>The results indicate that I have high emotional stability and tend to think pragmatically while still
                                empathising emotionally with others. I have a vivid imagination and become highly motivated
                                and passionate when something sparks my interest, often inspiring others around me to feel the
                                same.<br><br>
                                However, this energy comes at a cost; when the initial inspiration wears off, campaigners like
                                myself may find themselves locked in a struggle with self-discipline, especially consistency. I
                                typically tend to procrastinate and lose my work ethic, even while working on projects that I used
                                to love.</p>

                            <h1>Team Influence</h1>
                            <p>In a team setting, being a Campaigner means being a pillar of stability and motivation for the entire team; bringing a healthy dose of fun, creativity, and positivity to the work environment is core to the role. Being a mediator and voice of reason comes naturally, so any disagreements or problems the group may face are quickly resolved.
                                And as long as the team relationship stays strong, I can always rely on my teammates to keep me motivated if I start to lose steam.
                                </p>

                            <h1>Team Selection</h1>
                            <p>While I see the convenience that a short personality test brings to the table, It’s unreliable at best and not the first thing I would use to evaluate a teammate unless the results were extreme enough to raise concern.
                                When looking for the most effective teammates, I think the key traits to look out for are reliability, passion, and creativity.

                        </div>

                        <div class="sectionContent">
                            <h1>Overview</h1>
                            <p>I want to create the ultimate lightweight overlay for playing music on Spotify. The overlay will be bound to a hotkey that will bring up an informative minimalist window in the upper left corner of your screen. This window will have intuitive button-based controls that allow for rapid song selection and effortless volume adjustment, among other things—all without causing any disruption to your current focus.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Motivation</h1>
                            <p>Music is one of the common pleasures we all share, one way or another; almost everyone listens to music in some form.
                                Today, Spotify alone has 406 million users, with over 25% of Americans reporting that they use Spotify monthly.
                                That’s a lot of songs being skipped, and yet I can’t help feeling like the action is clunky and distracting. If I want more choice over what track to play next, I have to stop what I’m doing, open the application, and sift through my unorganised playlists until I find something that tickles my fancy.
                                What if I had a convenient overlay that knew what I wanted to play ahead of time, didn’t involve alt-tabbing and gave me more control than the original service, all without breaking focus on my workflow or gameplay.
                                </p>

                            <h1>Why is this important?</h1>
                            <p>The time that it takes to alt-tab and find something to listen to, or even simply adjust the volume of your song might seem insignificant, but whether you’re an artist immersed in a project or a gamer min-maxing every decision, you’d be surprised how much a simple alt-tab can shift your focus, not to mention the time it takes to alt-tab, especially in some fullscreen applications, definitely adds up.
                                I have experienced first-hand the kind of difference a simple quality of life change like this can make. For example, in Adobe After Effects, I often work with dozens of effects at once, which involves opening a nested dropdown menu or selecting the painfully slow search window to find the effect I’m looking for, which works fine. Still, when I tried the FX Console plugin by VideoCopilot, my workflow suddenly felt more focused, streamlined, and much quicker. I couldn’t go back to the built-in methods. FX Console achieved this by adding a simple hotkey that opened a more optimised search overlay that I could immediately type into without using any mouse input.
                                </p>
                            <img src="https://www.videocopilot.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Animation.gif" alt="Gif of the plugin"/>
                            <p>In reality, the time saved is minimal, but the perceived difference is much more valuable because I’m not losing my train of thought and, in turn, getting more work done. In this case, the seamless overlay makes all the difference.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h1>Acknowledgement</h1>
                            <p>Before I get more in-depth, I want to acknowledge that Spotify does currently have a built-in overlay integrated with the windows media keys, but this overlay offers no real convenience over alt-tabbing, and its intrusive implementation is more frustrating than anything, which is partly what inspired me to make this tool.
                                I also want to clarify that Spotify has built-in keybinds, but they’re only useable with the application in focus; in addition to that, they’re a burden to press and unchangeable.</p>

                            <h1>Overlay Features</h1>
                            <p><u1>
                                <li>Instantly pause and play your music with keybinds.</li>
                                <li>Rapidly cycle back and forth through your songs assisted by a visual queue.</li>
                                <li>Quick and precise volume adjustment using the scroll wheel.</li>
                                <li>Skip through your track with an inbuilt scrubber.</li>
                                <li>Select new music through your playlists or recommended songs.</li>
                                <li>Clearly displayed track information, e.g. Song title, artist name, album.</li>
                            </u1></p>

                            <h1>What comes next?</h1>
                            <p>In future versions, I want to implement basic customisation options such as custom layouts, colour themes and toggling GUI elements.
                                Outside the scope of the overlay but included in the program, I would like to try implementing live audio mixing with an EQ and savable presets, accessible with keybinds. I like the idea of being able to apply a low-pass preset rather than entirely pausing the track to concentrate.
                                And if the program is a success, it might be worth looking into support for other streaming services and even local directories.
                                </p>

                            <h1>Visual Presentation</h1>
                            <p>The core visual elements of the overlay start with a primary set of three cards; the middle card represents the current song, with the other two representing the previous and following songs. There is a vertical volume bar to the left, and beneath these elements is the playback/scrubber bar and recommended similar songs. The overlay will clearly display all information such as the song and artist name, focusing on avoiding clutter.</p>

                            <h1>Controls</h1>
                            <p>What takes this GUI to the next level are the intuitive and responsive controls, all of which will be customisable.
                                By default, the overlay is hidden and will only display as long as the keybind is held; this keybind is “alt” by default, which is easy to press during other activities and feels familiar due to its association with bringing up other windows.
                                The following table demonstrates the default key binds and their actions while alt is held.</p>
                                
                                <table>

                            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                            <p>The program will be built for Windows in Python and utilise the Tekore library to take advantage of Spotify’s Web API.
                                I plan to use Tekore over the more common Spotipy library for general ease of use and simplicity, but this could change.
                                </p>

                            <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                            <p>Once we start working on the project, the required skills may change or evolve. The current expected skills needed to complete this project are as follows:
                                <u1>
                                    <li>Knowledge of the Tekore library for integration with Spotify.</li>
                                    <li>Knowledge of the pygame library for creating the overlay window itself.</li>
                                    <li>Knowledge of the tkinter library for creating the overlay’s GUI.</li>
                                    <li>Basic knowledge of the pywin32 library for changing focus within Windows.</li>
                                    <li>A basic understanding of Python’s syntax.</li>
                                </u1>
                            </p>

                            <h1>Outcome</h1>
                            <p>If the development of this program is successful, we will have created a streamlined solution to alt-tabbing that encourages focus, productivity, and at the very least, a more eye-pleasing alternative to the windows media overlay.
                                My friends and I will get the Spotify overlay we always wanted, and hopefully, you will too.
                                </p>
